Management Node Hardware Correction
Summary
Date:  November 3, 2025
Project:  ENBD Pearl Museum - Jewellery Box Interactive
Document:  jewellery_box_system_recommendations.md
Issue Identified
The original recommendations incorrectly specified hardware with only 2 Ethernet ports  (ASUS
PN51, Intel NUC, Helix) when the system requires 4 Ethernet ports :
- 3 ports for plinths (5m connections each)
- 1 port for Q-SYS server room (40m connection)
Solution Provided
The document has been comprehensively updated with TWO VIABLE OPTIONS , each with complete
specifications, exact dimensions, and procurement details.
OPTION 1: Industrial Mini PC with 4 Native Ethernet

- Ethernet: 4x Intel Gigabit LAN (Intel i210-AT chipset)
- Cooling:  Fanless (passive aluminum chassis)
- Power:  36W (12V 3A adapter included)
- Operating Temp:  0-60°C (industrial-grade)
- Certifications:  CE, FCC, RoHS
- MTBF:  >50,000 hours (5.7 years)
Physical Dimensions:
- Width: 187mm (7.36”)
- Depth: 140mm (5.51”)
- Height: 42mm (1.65”)
- Weight: 1.0kg (2.2 lbs)

--- page 2 ---
- T otal Depth Required: 200mm (7.87”) including cable clearance
- Mounting: Middle Atlantic U1 vented rack shelf
- Weight with Shelf: 1.5kg (3.3 lbs)
Cost Breakdown:
- Qotom Q355G4-S02: $420
- 1U Rack Shelf: $50
- Total: $470
Why This is Recommended:
1. ✅ 4 native Gigabit Ethernet ports (no adapters)
2. ✅ Fanless operation (silent for museum)
3. ✅ Industrial-grade (24/7 operation)
4. ✅ Low power (36W)
5. ✅ Single device (fewer failure points)
6. ✅ Proven platform (widely used in firewall/routing)
7. ✅ Cost-effective ($470 vs $725+ for alternatives)
Alternative:  Protectli Vault VP4650
- Intel i5-8250U (newer, faster)
- 4x Gigabit LAN
- 146mm x 145mm x 54mm
- Cost: ~$650
- Better performance but higher cost
OPTION 2: Mini PC + Managed Ethernet Switch
Configuration:
Component A:  Intel NUC 11 Pro (NUC11TNHi5)
- Processor: Intel i5-1135G7 (quad-core, 2.4-4.2GHz)
- RAM: 8GB DDR4-3200
- Storage: 256GB NVMe SSD
- Ethernet: 2x ports (1x Gigabit + 1x 2.5GbE)
- Dimensions: 117mm x 112mm x 42mm
- Power: 90W
- Cost: $500
Component B:  Industrial Managed Switch
- Option B1:  TRENDnet TI-PG541i (Industrial, Recommended)
- 5x Gigabit Ethernet ports
- DIN-rail mountable
- Operating T emp: -40°C to 75°C
- Web-based management, VLAN, QoS
- Dimensions: 144mm x 110mm x 32mm
- Power: 20W
- Cost: $175
Option B2:  Netgear GS305E (Budget Alternative)
5x Gigabit Ethernet ports• 
• 2

--- page 3 ---
Commercial-grade (0-50°C)
Basic management, VLAN, QoS
Dimensions: 94mm x 100mm x 27mm
Power: 12W
Cost: $35
System Architecture:
NUC Port 1→ TRENDnet Switch →3 Plinths
NUC Port 2→ Direct to Q -SYS (40m cable)
Rack Mounting:
- Both devices side-by-side on 1U shelf
- Combined Width: 261mm (10.3”)
- T otal Depth: 160mm (6.3”)
- Weight with Shelf: 2.0kg (4.4 lbs)
Cost Options:
- NUC + TRENDnet + Shelf: $725
- NUC + Netgear + Shelf: $585
When to Choose Option 2:
- Need modern processor performance
- Want spare Ethernet ports for expansion
- Require advanced switch diagnostics (VLAN, port mirroring)
- Prefer modular architecture (replace components independently)
Trade-offs:
- ⚠️ More components (2 devices vs 1)
- ⚠️ Higher complexity (switch configuration)
- ⚠️ Higher power (110W vs 36W)
- ⚠️ More expensive ($255-$155 more)
- ⚠️ NUC has a fan (quiet but not silent)
