Jewellery Box Interactive Installation -
Technical Recommendations
Project:  ENBD Pearl Museum - Jewellery Box Interactive
Document Date:  November 3, 2025
Prepared For:  AL T ayer Stocks / 2D:3D
Reference:  ATS-50957-ENBD-PEARL-MA-2D3D-0040
Executive Summary
This document provides comprehensive technical recommendations for implementing the jewellery
box interactive installation at the ENBD Pearl Museum. The system comprises 3 interactive plinths
connected to a management node, which interfaces with the Q-SYS show control system in the server
room. Based on analysis of the project requirements and the existing design documentation, I recom‐
mend an Ethernet-based architecture  for maximum reliability, bidirectional communication
capability, and seamless Q-SYS integration.
⚠️ IMPORTANT CORRECTION NOTICE - NOVEMBER 3,
2025
ISSUE IDENTIFIED:  The original management node hardware recommendations (ASUS PN51, Intel
NUC, Helix) were INCORRECT  as they only provide 2 native Ethernet ports. This system requires 4
Ethernet ports :
- 3x connections to plinths (SH3-C5, SH3-C6, SH3-C7) via 5m Cat6 cables
- 1x connection to Q-SYS server room via 40m Cat6a cable
CORRECTED RECOMMENDATIONS:  This document now provides TWO viable hardware solutions:
OPTION 1: Industrial Mini PC with 4 Native Ethernet Ports
(RECOMMENDED) ⭐
Model:  Qotom Q355G4-S02 (Intel i5-5200U, 4x Gigabit LAN)
Cost:  ~$470 (with rack shelf)
Key Benefits:  Fanless (silent), industrial-grade, single device, 36W power
Dimensions:  187mm x 140mm x 42mm (fits in 1U rack)
OPTION 2: Mini PC + Managed Ethernet Switch
Configuration:  Intel NUC 11 Pro + TRENDnet 5-port switch (or Netgear GS305E budget)
Cost:  ~$725 (industrial) or ~$585 (budget)
Key Benefits:  Modern processor, expandability, modular architecture
PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Qotom Q355G4  for best reliability, cost-effectiveness, and silent
operation in a museum environment.•

1. Communication Protocol Decision
1.1 Plinth to Management Node Communication (5m runs)
RECOMMENDATION: Cat6 Ethernet with OSC over UDP
Rationale:
Why NOT DMX:
- Unidirectional Limitation:  Standard DMX512 is unidirectional (controller → devices). While RDM
(Remote Device Management) adds bidirectional capability, it’s primarily designed for lighting fixtures
and not well-suited for custom control applications
- Limited Data Rate:  DMX512 runs at 250 kbit/s with 512 channels per universe - adequate but
inflexible for future expansion
- Protocol Complexity:  Would require DMX encoding/decoding at each plinth and custom protocol
mapping
- Q-SYS Integration:  Q-SYS doesn’t natively handle DMX as a control protocol (it’s primarily for
audio/video/control systems)
- Bidirectional Requirement:  Your system needs SEND (button events, switch status) and RECEIVE
(motor control, LED commands) - this is cumbersome with DMX/RDM
Why Ethernet (Cat6):
- Native Bidirectional:  Full-duplex communication allows simultaneous send/receive
- OSC Compatibility:  Open Sound Control (OSC) over UDP is explicitly mentioned in your design
document and is natively supported by Q-SYS
- Future-Proof:  Sufficient bandwidth (1 Gbps) for any future enhancements
- Q-SYS Native:  Q-SYS Core has built-in Ethernet networking and excellent OSC support
- Reliability:  At 5m, Cat6 is extremely reliable with minimal EMI concerns
- Standardization:  Uses standard IT networking protocols, easier to troubleshoot and maintain
- Cost-Effective:  Cat6 cable and RJ45 connectors are readily available and inexpensive
1.2 Management Node to Q-SYS Server Room (40m run)
RECOMMENDATION: Cat6a Shielded (STP) Ethernet
Rationale:
Q-SYS Native Protocol:  Q-SYS Core is network-based and designed for Ethernet connectivity
Distance:  40m is well within the 100m Cat6a specification
Shielding:  S/FTP (shielded/foiled twisted pair) provides protection against EMI in commercial en‐
vironments where lighting, motors, and AV equipment create electrical noise
10 Gigabit Capable:  Cat6a supports 10GBASE-T up to 100m, providing future-proofing
OSC/TCP/UDP:  Q-SYS supports OSC, TCP, and UDP protocols natively - no protocol conversion
needed
Reliability:  Proven technology for mission-critical AV installations•

2. Plinth Hardware Recommendations
2.1 Recommended Solution: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB) with
Industrial Accessories
Model:  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, 4GB RAM
Part Number:  RPI4-MODBP-4GB
Why Raspberry Pi 4:
PROS:
- Native Ethernet:  Built-in Gigabit Ethernet (no shields or adapters needed)
- Sufficient I/O:  40-pin GPIO header provides ample digital I/O for button, switch, LED, and motor con‐
trol
- Processing Power:  Quad-core ARM processor can handle network protocols, motor control, and lo‐
gic
- Operating System:  Linux-based (Raspberry Pi OS) allows use of proven libraries (Python OSC,
pigpio for motor control)
- Development:  Easy to program and test; large community support
- Reliability:  Proven in many installation projects worldwide
- Cost-Effective:  ~$55 USD per unit
- Remote Access:  Can be remotely accessed via SSH for diagnostics and updates
CONS & MITIGATIONS:
- SD Card Failure Risk:  Standard SD cards can fail in 24/7 installations
- MITIGATION:  Use industrial-grade SD cards (SanDisk High Endurance, Samsung PRO Endurance)
rated for continuous operation
- ALTERNATIVE:  Use USB boot with industrial USB drive, disabling SD entirely
- No Real-Time OS:  Linux is not real-time, but for this application (motor control with stepper driver
doing the timing), it’s adequate
- Power Supply:  Requires stable 5V power
- MITIGATION:  Use official Raspberry Pi power supply (5V/3A) or industrial DIN-rail power supply
Alternative Considered: Arduino (Not Recommended)
Why Arduino is Less Suitable:
- Ethernet Not Native:  Requires Ethernet shield (Arduino Uno R4 WiFi has networking, but limited)
- Limited Processing:  Harder to implement robust OSC protocol handling3

--- page 4 ---
- Programming Complexity:  Implementing network protocols and multi-tasking is more difficult
- No Operating System:  Bare-metal programming increases development time and reduces flexibil‐
ity
- Maintenance:  Harder to remotely diagnose and update

Length 5 meters per cable (3 cables total)
Conductor 23 AWG solid copper (for permanent installa‐
tion)
Jacket CMR or CMP rated (for in-wall/plenum
installation if required)
Connector RJ45 modular plugs, factory terminated or
field-terminated with keystones
Color Code T568B wiring standard
Recommended Brand Belden 2413, Commscope/Systimax, or equi‐
valent
Shielding Not required at 5m in typical environment, but
can use Cat6 F/UTP if EMI is a concern
Why Cat6 UTP at 5m:
- 5 meters is very short; EMI/RFI unlikely to be an issue
- UTP is more flexible and easier to terminate
- Cost-effective
- If plinths are near high-power lighting or motor drives, upgrade to Cat6 F/UTP (foiled)14

4.2 Management Node to Q-SYS Server Room (40m run)
Specification Details
Cable Type Cat6a S/FTP (Shielded/Foiled T wisted Pair)
Length 40 meters (single continuous run, no splices)
Conductor 23 AWG solid copper
Jacket CMR or CMP rated (check local fire codes)
Connector RJ45 shielded modular plugs with metal shells
Color Code T568B wiring standard
Shielding S/FTP - overall shield + individual pair foil
shields
Grounding Shield must be grounded at ONE end only
(typically at server room) to avoid ground
loops
Recommended Brand Belden 10GXS, Siemon TERA Cat6a, or equi‐
valent
Installation Use cable tray or conduit; avoid running
parallel to AC power cables
Why Cat6a S/FTP at 40m:
- 40m run may pass through walls, above ceiling, near HVAC, lighting, and power distribution
- Shielding protects against EMI/RFI for reliable operation
- Cat6a supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet (future-proofing)
- Critical link to Q-SYS; must be rock-solid reliable15

Wiring Best Practices:
- Use shielded cable for motor wiring to reduce electrical noise
- Keep low-voltage signal wiring separate from motor power wiring
- Use proper strain relief for all connections
- Label all wires clearly
4.5 Cable Management and Installation
Cable Trays:  Use metal cable tray or conduit for the 40m run to server room • 16

--- page 17 ---
Separation:  Maintain 300mm (12”) separation between data cables and AC power cables
Drip Loops:  Install drip loops at entry points to prevent water ingress
Labeling:  Label both ends of every cable with unique identifier
Testing:  T est all Ethernet cables with cable tester (continuity, wiring map, length) before
connecting equipment
5. Q-SYS Integration
5.1 Q-SYS Overview
Q-SYS (by QSC) is a software-based audio, video, and control platform commonly used in commercial
AV installations. The Q-SYS Core (processor) runs Q-SYS Designer software and provides:
Audio processing and routing
Video processing
Control logic (Lua scripting)
Network connectivity (built-in Ethernet)
Third-party control integration  via TCP/IP, UDP, serial, GPIO
5.2 Recommended Integration Method
Primary Recommendation: OSC over UDP
Parameter Value
Protocol OSC (Open Sound Control) over UDP
Port UDP 5010 (configurable in Q-SYS Designer)
Direction Bidirectional (Management Node ←→ Q-SYS
Core)
Message Format OSC messages (see Section 1.3)
Q-SYS Implementation Use Q-SYS “Named Control” with UDP
Scripting Component
Why OSC over UDP:
- Q-SYS Native Support:  Q-SYS Designer has excellent OSC support via Lua scripting
- Simplicity:  OSC is human-readable and easy to debug
- Performance:  UDP is low-latency (no TCP handshake overhead)
- Already Specified:  Your design document mentions “OSC trigger over UDP”
- Flexibility:  Easy to add new messages without protocol changes
Alternative: TCP/IP Socket Communication•

--- page 18 ---
Parameter Value
Protocol TCP/IP with custom ASCII commands
Port TCP 1700 (configurable)
Direction Bidirectional
Message Format ASCII strings (e.g.,
“PLINTH1_BUTTON_PRESS\n”)
Q-SYS Implementation Use Q-SYS “TCP/IP Client” or “TCP/IP Server”
Scripting Component
Why TCP/IP:
- Guaranteed Delivery:  TCP ensures messages are delivered (vs. UDP’s “fire and forget”)
- Connection Status:  Can detect if connection is lost
- Q-SYS Support:  Q-SYS has robust TCP/IP scripting components
Trade-offs:
- TCP has higher overhead (handshake, acknowledgment)
- For button presses, UDP is sufficient (if a button press is missed, user can press again)
- For motor commands, TCP might be preferable (guaranteed delivery)
Recommendation:  Start with OSC over UDP  (as specified in design), but implement connection
monitoring and automatic reconnection in management node software.
5.3 Q-SYS Designer Configuration
Step 1: Add Named Controls
In Q-SYS Designer, create Named Controls for each plinth:
plinth1_button  (Boolean - button state)
plinth1_maintenance  (Boolean - maintenance switch state)
plinth1_motor_open  (Boolean - trigger motor open)
plinth1_motor_close  (Boolean - trigger motor close)
plinth1_led_brightness  (Integer 0-255)
Repeat for plinth2_  and plinth3_ .
Step 2: Add UDP Scripting Component
Drag “Scriptable Controls” component into design
Configure to listen on UDP port 5010
Write Lua script to:
Parse incoming OSC messages
Update Named Controls
Send outgoing OSC messages when controls change
Step 3: Integrate with Show Control Logic
Connect Named Controls to Block Controllers (for audio, video, lighting)
Example: When plinth1_button  goes high:• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 18

--- page 19 ---
Disable plinth2_button  and plinth3_button  (interlock)
Trigger audio cue
Trigger video content on LED ring
Trigger lighting scene
Send plinth1_motor_open  command back to plinth
5.4 Network Configuration
Device IP Address Subnet Mask Gateway

Q-SYS Core 192.168.10.50 255.255.255.0 -
Note:  If Q-SYS is on existing facility network, use appropriate IP addressing. Consider VLAN
segmentation for control network isolation.
5.5 Software Requirements
Management Node Software:
Operating System:  Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (for mini PC) or Raspberry Pi OS Lite (for RPi)
Programming Language:  Python 3.10+ or Node.js 18+
Libraries:
python-osc  (for OSC messaging)
asyncio  (for concurrent handling of multiple plinths)
logging  (for diagnostics)
Service Management:  systemd service for automatic startup and restart on failure
Monitoring:  Watchdog timer to restart service if it hangs
Plinth Software (Raspberry Pi):
Operating System:  Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless)
Programming Language:  Python 3.10+
Libraries:
python-osc  (for OSC messaging)
RPi.GPIO  or gpiod (for GPIO control)
pigpio (for hardware PWM for stepper motor)
Service Management:  systemd service
Remote Access:  SSH enabled for maintenance
5.6 Middleware Requirements
None Required  - Q-SYS and the management node can communicate directly via OSC/UDP or TCP/IP.
No additional middleware software (e.g., Crestron control processor, AMX controller) is needed.•

8. Reliability and Maintenance Considerations
8.1 Reliability Enhancements for 2-Year Operation
Component Failure Risk Mitigation Strategy
Raspberry Pi SD Card HIGH - SD cards can fail in
24/7 operationUse industrial-grade SD cards
(SanDisk High Endurance
rated for continuous record‐
ing). Alternatively, boot from
USB SSD. Keep backup im‐
ages.
Stepper Motor MEDIUM - Mechanical wear Use high-quality stepper mo‐
tor with rated lifetime >
10,000 open/close cycles.
Lubricate mechanism as per
manufacturer specs.
Ethernet Cables LOW - Reliable if properly in‐
stalledUse shielded cables for 40m
run. Properly terminate and
test. Secure connections with
locking RJ45 connectors.
Power Supplies MEDIUM - Can fail if over‐
loadedUse power supplies with
20-30% headroom. Industrial-
grade Mean Well or similar.
Button Contacts MEDIUM - Mechanical wear Use high-quality momentary
switch rated for > 100,000
actuations.
Software Crashes MEDIUM - Software bugs Implement systemd service
with automatic restart. Use
watchdog timer. Remote
monitoring.33

13. Summary and Final Recommendations (UPDATED)
⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION NOTICE
Issue Identified:  The original recommendations suggested hardware (ASUS PN51, Intel NUC) with
only 2 native Ethernet ports, which is insufficient  for this system’s requirement of 4 Ethernet ports
(3 plinths + 1 Q-SYS).
Resolution:  Updated recommendations now provide TWO viable options with accurate hardware
specifications that meet the 4-port requirement.
13.1 Communication Protocol (UNCHANGED)
Plinth ↔ Management Node:  Cat6 UTP Ethernet, 5m, OSC over UDP
Management Node ↔ Q-SYS:  Cat6a S/FTP Ethernet, 40m, OSC over UDP or TCP/IP
13.2 Hardware (CORRECTED)
Plinth Hardware (UNCHANGED)
Each Plinth:  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB), TMC2209 stepper driver, industrial SD card
Quantity:  3 plinths
Management Node Hardware (CORRECTED - TWO OPTIONS)
OPTION 1: Qotom Q355G4 Mini PC (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

• 
• 42

--- page 43 ---
RAM:  8GB DDR3L
Storage:  128GB mSATA SSD
Ethernet: 4x Native Gigabit LAN ports (Intel i210-AT)
Cooling: Fanless  (silent, no moving parts)
Power:  36W (12V 3A)
Dimensions:  187mm x 140mm x 42mm (7.36” x 5.51” x 1.65”)
Operating Temp:  0-60°C (industrial-grade)
Cost:  ~$470 (including rack shelf)
Why Recommended:
- ✅ 4 native Ethernet ports (no adapters needed)
- ✅ Fanless operation (silent for museum environment)
- ✅ Industrial-grade reliability (24/7 operation)
- ✅ Low power (36W)
